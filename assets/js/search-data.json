            "title": "Introducing the Humanitarian Data Exchange",
            "content": "Introduction . The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX for short) is an open, online platform for sharing data across countries and organisations. It was launched in 2014 with the aim of making humanitarian data easy to find and explore, however, with currently more than 20 000 datasets on the platform, it can be a little intimidating for new users and it is easy to get lost! The purpose of this blogpost is to provide an overview of what kind of data is available on the HDX platform, how to search for the data you want, how to access it and how we at ADH interact with HDX data. If you are already familiar with HDX and have some specific questions, you may want to dive straight into their FAQ. . The HDX platform runs on CKAN, an open source data management system that is used by hundreds of organisations around the world such as our ADH data repository, and various national governments including USA, Canada, Singapore, Australia and others. . When using CKAN, it is important to understand the difference between the system&#39;s definition of a dataset vs a resource. A dataset is a collection of related data resources, while a resource is a single file. It may be useful to think of a dataset as a folder on your computer and a resource as a file in that folder. . Types of Data Available on HDX . HDX data is available in a wide variety of formats, from spreadsheets (eg: XLSX, CSV) to geographic (eg: SHP, geoJSON) to image (eg: geoTIFF, PNG) and even documents like PDF, DOCX, and PPTX. Some datasets will include the same data in different formats under different resources. It is therefore not always necessary to download an entire dataset, but rather, only look for formats that you are comfortable with or are able to use. Different formats of data are also often different sizes. For a tutorial on exploring an HDX dataset with different formats of the same data, see here ENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE. . How to access and search for data on HDX . Searching for datasets on HDX is done in two ways: by searching for terms that you type into the search bar found at the top of almost every page on HDX, and by filtering a list of search results. The HDX search webpage can be found here and a screenshot of the same is shown in figure 1. . Entering a search term causes HDX to look for matching terms in the titles, descriptions, locations and tags of a dataset. This is very similar to searching for something on Google. The resulting list of items can be further refined using the filter options on the left side of the search result. You can filter by location, tag, organisation, license and format as well as filtering for some special classes of datasets. . Once you have narrowed your search down to a manageable list of datasets, you need to click on one and see if it contains any resources that you wish to use. You can download any resource by clicking on the download button to the right of the resource. As noted above, pay attention to the format of the resource that you wish to download and ensure that you download it in the correct format. . . HDX have a suite of data visualisation tools that will enable you to explore many of their datasets. It is usually possible to then download the data that fed the visualisation. . How ADH uses HDX data . The African Data Hub has its own CKAN data repository. The main aim of the ADH data repository is to provide accurate, up-to-date data on African countries. This repository is described in this ENTER PUBLISHED LINK blog post. The ADH data repository contains many datasets that are hosted on the HDX platform. The HDX platform has a global focus, while ADH has an African focus, thus it is our intention to highlight HDX&#39;s African datasets and make them easier to find as our repository holds significantly fewer than 20 000 datasets. The HDX African datasets that we have on our repository can be found here. In most cases, we simply provide the URL to where the data is hosted on the HDX platform, as there is little sense in hosting and maintaining those datasets ourselves. . Conclusion . The Humanitarian Data Exchange is a brilliant global, opensource, online data respository with thousands of datasets covering a wide range of humanitarian and crisis-related topics. As a data journalist, it is well worth the effort to spend some time familiarising yourself with it. The African Data Hub has an opensource, online data repository with an African focus that is continually growing. If you are looking for data from African countries, it could be worth looking on the ADH data repository first before searching through HDX as we may have found it already. .",

            "content": "Introduction . The African Data Hub (ADH) seeks to support and promote quality data-driven journalism in Africa by providing newsrooms, researchers, and the general public with easy access to quality African data. African data is typically difficult to find, stored in unwieldy formats, and is often out of date. ADH is working to remedy this by actively seeking out interesting and useful African datasets, converting them to more easily accessible formats, updating and creating combined datasets where possible storing them all on our opensource, online, CKAN data repository. . CKAN is an open source data management system that is used by hundreds of organisations around the world including the national governments of USA, Canada, Singapore, Australia and others. We use this resource to host any data we find that we believe may be useful in serving our mandate in the promotion of quality data-driven journalism in Africa. . Dataset vs Resource . When using CKAN, it is important to understand the difference between the system&#39;s definition of a dataset vs a resource. A dataset is a collection of related data resources, while a resource is a single file. It may be useful to think of a dataset as a folder on your computer and a resource as a file in that folder. When posting data on CKAN, you first need to create a dataset and fill in the required metadata. Then you can add resources either by uploading files, or linking them via URL. . Metadata . The importance of complete and correct metadata cannot be overstated. Metadata provides context for a given dataset which allows a potential user to understand what it is about, where it came from, how it was created and how it can be used. The following table provides details on the required metadata. . %%html &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table 1: &lt;/b&gt;Metadata description&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-j1i3{border-color:inherit;position:-webkit-sticky;position:sticky;text-align:left;top:-1px;vertical-align:top; will-change:transform} .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} @media screen and (max-width: 767px) {.tg {width: auto !important;}.tg col {width: auto !important;}.tg-wrap {overflow-x: auto;-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;}}&lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;tg-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th class=&quot;tg-j1i3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metadata&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th class=&quot;tg-j1i3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;A descriptive title&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;tg-0pky&quot;&gt;Brief description of what is in the data - is this the industry standard, how does it compare to similar datasets, is this data hosted/used elsewhere?

It is therefore not always necessary to download an entire dataset, but rather, only look for formats that you are comfortable with or are able to use. Different formats of data are also often different sizes. For a tutorial on exploring a dataset with different formats of the same data, see here ENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE. . Many countries tend to release their data in PDF format. Unfortunately, data in PDF form is usually difficult to work with. As such, when we come across PDF data that we believe could be useful for an African data journalist, we try to extract the data and present it in csv or xlsx format, which is much easier to work with. When ever we do this, we are sure to include links to the original PDF documents so that the authenticity and correctness of the extracted data can be verified by anyone who wishes to use it. . Finding and accessing data . Our data is organised in terms of datasets, organisations, groups and tags. Datasets have already been described above. . Organisations . Each organisation that is part of ADH is represented by an organisation on CKAN. Any data that was found, produced or used by a particular ADH partner can be found in that partner&#39;s organisation. . Groups . Groups indicate the data category, for example Health data, Economic data etc. A dataset may belong to more than one group. Groups also serve as folders for all datasets used in a particular data tool or project. Finally, if several different datasets have all been sourced from the same place, then all of those datasets are placed in a group named after that source. See for example, the Humanitarian Data Exchange, and the accompanying blog postENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE. . Tags . Tags identify interesting characteristics of the data. For example, if the data contains gender information, it is tagged with gender, if it is geographical data, it is tagged with geodata. . Search . Searching for datasets on the ADH data repository is done in two ways: by searching for terms that you type into the search bar found at the top of almost every page on the ADH data repository, and by filtering a list of search results. Entering a search term causes CKAN to look for matching terms in the titles, descriptions, locations and tags of a dataset. This is very similar to searching for something on Google. The resulting list of items can be further refined using the filter options on the left side of the search result. You can filter by organisation, group, tag, format, and license. . Once you have narrowed your search down to a manageable list of datasets, you need to click on one and see if it contains any resources that you wish to use. You can download any resource by clicking on download on the dropdown explore button to the right of the resource. As noted above, pay attention to the format of the resource that you wish to download and ensure that you download it in the correct format. . Uploading Data . CKAN controls who can upload or make changes to existing data through user permissions. There are three levels of user permissions with administrator being the highest, followed by editor, and member. These permissions are assigned at both the organisation and group level. Only administrators and members are able to upload or edit data on CKAN. Members are able to view and download the data. There is also a system administrator who has control over the entire system. Visitors to the site, that is, people who do not have login credentials, are only able to view and download public data, while users with login credentials are able to view and download both public and private datasets. . Uploading data to the ADH CKAN platform is really easy. First, click on the datasets tab at the top of the screen and then click on the add datasets button as seen in Figure 1. . . You will be taken to a webpage like the one shown in Figure 2. Now fill in all of the metadata as described in Table 1. . .

            "content": "The csv file is considerably smaller than the tif file, so let&#39;s begin with that. The first thing we need to do is convert it from a simple csv to geojson in order to be able to map it. . The tif file is very big - around 21GB when unzipped. This is too big for most machines to handle in Python, and you would be better off using a decidicated mapping tool like QGIS. As such, we should rather look to use the csv file, which is much smaller. However, first we should confirm that the data is the same. To do that, we select only a small part of the tif file and compare it with the same area in the csv file. . with rasterio.open(&#39;zip:///%szaf_women_2020_geotiff.zip!/zaf_women_2020.tif&#39;%data_path) as src: n = 500 data = src.read(1, window=Window(0, 0, n, n)) print(&#39;Band1 has shape&#39;, data.shape) height = data.shape[0] width = data.shape[1] cols, rows = np.meshgrid(np.arange(width), np.arange(height)) xs, ys = rasterio.transform.xy(src.transform, rows, cols) lons= np.array(xs) lats = np.array(ys) print(&#39;lons shape&#39;, lons.shape) . Band1 has shape (500, 500) lons shape (500, 500) . Now we have a subset of the tif file, but in order to be able to compare it with the csv file, we need to convert both into geopandas dataframes. To do that, we need to change the shape of the tif file&#39;s data. . lons2 = lons.flatten() lats2 = lats.flatten() data2 = data.flatten() data_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;pop_dens&#39;:data2,&#39;latitude&#39;:lats2,&#39;longitude&#39;:lons2}).dropna() data_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data_df.pop_dens, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(data_df.longitude, data_df.latitude, crs=&quot;EPSG:4326&quot;)) lon_min= data_df.longitude.min() lon_max = data_df.longitude.max() lat_min= data_df.latitude.min() lat_max = data_df.latitude.max() . gdf_box = gpd.read_file(&#39;%szaf_women_2020_csv_geo.geojson&#39;%data_path,bbox=(lon_min, lat_min, lon_max, lat_max)) . Right, let&#39;s take a look at the subset of the tif data. We can also zoom in to see that each point in the tif file is a square pixel. . plt.style.use(&quot;dark_background&quot;) data = np.nan_to_num(data) fg_color = &#39;white&#39; bg_color = &#39;black&#39; fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121) plt.imshow(data) ax1.set_title(&#39;Plot of tif file&#39;, color=&#39;white&#39;) # set figure facecolor fig.patch.set_facecolor(&#39;black&#39;) # set tick and ticklabel color ax1.axes.tick_params(color=fg_color, labelcolor=fg_color) ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122) plt.imshow(data) plt.xlim(150,180) plt.ylim(180,150) ax2.set_title(&#39;Zoomed&#39;, color=&#39;white&#39;) # set tick and ticklabel color ax2.axes.tick_params(color=fg_color, labelcolor=fg_color) # set imshow outline for spine in ax1.axes.spines.values(): spine.set_edgecolor(fg_color) for spine in ax2.axes.spines.values(): spine.set_edgecolor(fg_color) fig.tight_layout() . Now let&#39;s compare the two geodataframes of the csv and tif subsets. Once again, we show a zoomed in image on the right. Bearing in mind that the tif data has been converted from a pixel to a point, we note that the two datasets place their points on opposite corners of the pixel. This is not a concern as both points represent the same pixel. . fg_color = &#39;white&#39; bg_color = &#39;black&#39; plt.style.use(&quot;dark_background&quot;) fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121) gdf_box.plot(ax=ax1,label=&#39;csv&#39;) data_gdf.plot(ax=ax1,color=&#39;red&#39;,alpha=0.8, markersize=7,label=&#39;tif&#39;) ax1.set_title(&#39;Points from both datasets&#39;,color=fg_color) # set figure facecolor fig.patch.set_facecolor(&#39;black&#39;) # set tick and ticklabel color ax1.axes.tick_params(color=fg_color, labelcolor=fg_color) plt.legend() ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122) gdf_box.plot(ax=ax2,label=&#39;csv&#39;) data_gdf.plot(ax=ax2,color=&#39;red&#39;,alpha=0.8, markersize=7,label=&#39;tif&#39;) ax2.set_xlim(16.04,16.048) ax2.set_ylim(-22.050,-22.044) #ax2.set_ylim(-22.2044,-22.050) ax2.set_title(&#39;Zoomed&#39;,color=fg_color) # set tick and ticklabel color ax2.axes.tick_params(color=fg_color, labelcolor=fg_color) plt.legend() fig.tight_layout() . We have now determined that the csv and tif data refer to the same thing. As such, it is safe for us to continue our analysis using only the csv data. .",
