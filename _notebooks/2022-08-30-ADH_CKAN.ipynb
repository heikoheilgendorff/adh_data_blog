    "### Introduction\n",
    "The [African Data Hub](https://www.africadatahub.org/) (ADH) seeks to support and promote quality data-driven journalism in Africa by providing newsrooms, researchers, and the general public with easy access to quality African data. African data is typically difficult to find, stored in unwieldy formats, and is often out of date. ADH is working to remedy this by actively seeking out interesting and useful African datasets, converting them to more easily accessible formats, updating and creating combined datasets where possible storing them all on our opensource, online, CKAN [data repository](https://ckan.africadatahub.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "[CKAN](https://ckan.org/) is an open source data management system that is used by hundreds of organisations around the world including the national governments of USA, Canada, Singapore, Australia and others. We use this resource to host any data we find that we believe may be useful in serving our mandate in the promotion of quality data-driven journalism in Africa. \n",

    "### Dataset vs Resource\n",
    "When using CKAN, it is important to understand the difference between the system's definition of a `dataset` vs a `resource`. A dataset is a collection of related data resources, while a resource is a single file. It may be useful to think of a dataset as a folder on your computer and a resource as a file in that folder. When posting data on CKAN, you first need to create a dataset and fill in the required `metadata`. Then you can add resources either by uploading files, or linking them via URL. "

    "### Types of Data Available on the ADH data repository\n",
    "The data is available in a wide variety of formats, from spreadsheets (eg: XLSX, CSV) to geographic (eg: SHP, geoJSON) to image (eg: geoTIFF, PNG) and even documents like PDF, etc. Some datasets will include the same data in different formats under different resources. It is therefore not always necessary to download an entire dataset, but rather, only look for formats that you are comfortable with or are able to use. Different formats of data are also often different sizes. For a tutorial on exploring a dataset with different formats of the same data, see [here](https://heikoheilgendorff.github.io/adh_data_blog/geo%20data/population%20density/2022/08/12/geo-data-prep-tutorial.html) **ENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE**.\n",

    "Many countries tend to release their data in PDF format. Unfortunately, data in PDF form is usually difficult to work with. As such, when we come across PDF data that we believe could be useful for an African data journalist, we try to extract the data and present it in csv or xlsx format, which is much easier to work with. When ever we do this, we are sure to include links to the original PDF documents so that the authenticity and correctness of the extracted data can be verified by anyone who wishes to use it."

    "### Finding and accessing data\n",
    "Our data is organised in terms of `datasets`, `organisations`, `groups` and `tags`. Datasets have already been described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organisations\n",
    "Each organisation that is part of ADH is represented by an organisation on CKAN. Any data that was found, produced or used by a particular ADH partner can be found in that partner's [organisation](https://ckan.africadatahub.org/organization/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Groups\n",
    "[Groups](https://ckan.africadatahub.org/group/) indicate the data category, for example `Health` data, `Economic` data etc. A dataset may belong to more than one group. Groups also serve as folders for all datasets used in a particular data tool or project. Finally, if several different datasets have all been sourced from the same place, then all of those datasets are placed in a group named after that source. See for example, the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://ckan.africadatahub.org/group/hdx-humanitarian-data-exchange), and the accompanying [blog post](https://heikoheilgendorff.github.io/adh_data_blog/hdx/overview/ckan/data/2022/08/31/HDX_Blogpost.html)**ENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tags\n",
    "Tags identify interesting characteristics of the data. For example, if the data contains gender information, it is tagged with `gender`, if it is geographical data, it is tagged with `geodata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search\n",
    "Searching for datasets on the ADH data repository is done in two ways: by searching for terms that you type into the search bar found at the top of almost every page on the ADH data repository, and by filtering a list of search results. Entering a search term causes CKAN to look for matching terms in the titles, descriptions, locations and tags of a dataset. This is very similar to searching for something on Google. The resulting list of items can be further refined using the filter options on the left side of the search result. You can filter by organisation, group, tag, format, and license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have narrowed your search down to a manageable list of datasets, you need to click on one and see if it contains any resources that you wish to use. You can download any resource by clicking on `download` on the dropdown `explore` button to the right of the resource. As noted above, pay attention to the format of the resource that you wish to download and ensure that you download it in the correct format."
