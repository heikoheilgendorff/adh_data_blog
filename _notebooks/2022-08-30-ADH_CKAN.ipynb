    "### Introduction\n",
    "The [African Data Hub](https://www.africadatahub.org/) (ADH) seeks to support and promote quality data-driven journalism in Africa by providing newsrooms, researchers, and the general public with easy access to quality African data. African data is typically difficult to find, stored in unwieldy formats, and is often out of date. ADH is working to remedy this by actively seeking out interesting and useful African datasets, converting them to more easily accessible formats, updating and creating combined datasets where possible storing them all on our opensource, online, CKAN [data repository](https://ckan.africadatahub.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "[CKAN](https://ckan.org/) is an open source data management system that is used by hundreds of organisations around the world including the national governments of USA, Canada, Singapore, Australia and others. We use this resource to host any data we find that we believe may be useful in serving our mandate in the promotion of quality data-driven journalism in Africa. \n",

    "### Dataset vs Resource\n",
    "When using CKAN, it is important to understand the difference between the system's definition of a `dataset` vs a `resource`. A dataset is a collection of related data resources, while a resource is a single file. It may be useful to think of a dataset as a folder on your computer and a resource as a file in that folder. When posting data on CKAN, you first need to create a dataset and fill in the required `metadata`. Then you can add resources either by uploading files, or linking them via URL. "

    "The data is available in a wide variety of formats, from spreadsheets (eg: XLSX, CSV) to geographic (eg: SHP, geoJSON) to image (eg: geoTIFF, PNG) and even documents like PDF, etc. Some datasets will include the same data in different formats under different resources. It is therefore not always necessary to download an entire dataset, but rather, only look for formats that you are comfortable with or are able to use. Different formats of data are also often different sizes. For a tutorial on exploring a dataset with different formats of the same data, see [here](https://heikoheilgendorff.github.io/adh_data_blog/geo%20data/population%20density/2022/08/12/geo-data-prep-tutorial.html) **ENTER PUBLISHED LINK HERE**.\n",

As such, when we come across PDF data that we believe could be useful for an African data journalist, we try to extract the data and present it in csv or xlsx format, which is much easier to work with. When ever we do this, we are sure to include links to the original PDF documents so that the authenticity and correctness of the extracted data can be verified by anyone who wishes to use it."
