This blog is a staging point for blog posts on the ADH [website](https://www.africadatahub.org/). We use this blog as a place to post first drafts of our data blogs, which are created from Jupyter notebooks. This website is powered by [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats. From here, we rework the output into [Webflow](https://webflow.com) using embeded HTML and then publish on our website. If you have reached this website accidentally, please navigate to https://www.africadatahub.org/ to view the final versions of these posts.
